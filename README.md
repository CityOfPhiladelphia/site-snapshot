# Snapshot

Make a static snapshot of a site.

Usage:

```bash
scripts/snapshot.sh example.com
```

This will download all HTML, as well as any static assets on pages (JS, CSS, images). How long this takes depends on the size of the site.

If you don't want to download example, change the domain in the command.
